###Before Class:
1. Print one copy of the 'Weather Map Symbols BINGO Cards' (35 pages).
2. Print enough copies of 'Weather Map Symbols BINGO Key' so that 
   each pair of students can share one (1 page).
3. Print one copy of 'Weather Map Symbols BINGO Recorder' (1 page).
4. Laminate and cut out all printed material.

###During Class:
0. The first time you use this game, pass out one index card to each 
   student and ask them to cut in into 25 squares. These are the 
   tokens students will use to cover the symbols on the bingo cards.
1. Distribute one Card to each student and one Key to each dyad of
   students.
2. Open the file 'Weather Map Symbols BINGO Caller' in any modern 
   browser. You should be able to double click on it and have it open
   automatically.
3. Explain to the students that they will need to locate the symbol on
   the Key and then find if they have the symbol in the correct column
   on their individual Card.
4. Click the 'Draw' button in the center of the page. This will cause
   a random letter and symbol pair to appear on the screen.
5. Optionally, you can use the 'Weather Map Symbols BINGO Recorder' to
   mark which pairings you have called.
6. Subsequent clicks of the 'Draw' button will generate a new random
   letter and symbol pair. NOTE: The same letter and symbol pair can
   be generated more than once.
7. A students wins when they have five symbols covered in a row, column,
   or diagonal and yells, "BINGO!"

###Tips:
1. Ask the students to create a 'Free Space' by putting a token on the
   center most square.
2. Allow more than one winner per round. Three winners per round seems
   to work well.
3. Have the students switch cards after each round.
4. Other games you can play:
   a. Four Corners - Students win either by the traditional rules,
      or when they have all four corners of their card covered.
   b. Black Out - Students win when their entire board is covered.
